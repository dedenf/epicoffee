recently i've been lazy, too lazy, no coffee rituals, no fancy brewing tools, also no fancy coffee beans.
i've been using Nestcafe instant coffee as my caffeine boost, but it's not just that, here's my recipe:

* Nescafe
* Milk
* Sugar (optional)

first, heat the milk (half of the glass/cup/mug), i'm using microwave to heat the milk, after that, add Nescafe instant coffee (add sugar if you want to), mix it, after that pour hot water (if you want to).

enjoy!
